"<>Leland Gaunt</> opens a new shop in Castle Rock called Needful Things. Anyone who enters his store finds the object of his or her lifelong dreams and desires: a prized baseball card, a healing amulet. In addition to a token payment, <>Gaunt</> requests that each person perform a little \"deed,\" usually a seemingly innocent prank played on someone else from town."
