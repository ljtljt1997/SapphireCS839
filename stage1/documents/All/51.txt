"Imbued on every page with <>Frank McCourt</>'s astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while."
