"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid....He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. This is the Code of the Private Eye as defined by <>Raymond Chandler</> in his 1944 essay 'The Simple Act of Murder."
