"Ever since it was published in 1978, the picture-book presentation of <>Robert Frost</>'s poem \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" has been an enduring favorite. For this special edition with a new design, trim size, and three new spreads, <>Susan Jeffers</> has added more detail and subtle color to her sweeping backgrounds of frosty New England scenes."
