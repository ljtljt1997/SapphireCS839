"Beneath the kitchen floor is the world of the Borrowers -- <>Pod</> and <>Homily Clock</> and their daughter, <>Arrietty</>. In their tiny home, matchboxes double as roomy dressers and postage stamps hang on the walls like paintings. Whatever the Clocks need they simply borrow from the human beans who live above them. It's a comfortable life, but boring if you're a kid."
