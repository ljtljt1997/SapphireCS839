"As I Lay Dying is <>Faulkner</>'s harrowing account of the <>Bundren</> family's odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury <>Addie</>, their wife and mother. Narrated in turn by each of the family members—including <>Addie</> herself—as well as others, the novel ranges in mood, from dark comedy to the deepest pathos."
