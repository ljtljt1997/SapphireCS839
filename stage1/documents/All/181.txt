"Like his father and grandfather before him, <>Kino</> is a poor diver, gathering pearls from the gulf beds that once brought great wealth to the kings of Spain and now provide <>Kino</>, <>Juana</>, and their infant son with meager subsistence. Then, on a day like any other, <>Kino</> emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull's egg, as perfect as the moon."
