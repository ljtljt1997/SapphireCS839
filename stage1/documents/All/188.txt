"One of <>George Bernard Shaw</>'s best-known plays, <>Pygmalion</> was a rousing success on the London and New York stages, an entertaining motion picture and a great hit with its musical version, My Fair Lady. An updated and considerably revised version of the ancient Greek legend of <>Pygmalion</> and <>Galatea</>, the 20th-century story pokes fun at the antiquated British class system."
