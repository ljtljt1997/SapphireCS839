"In Breakfast of Champions, one of <>Kurt Vonnegut</>'sÂ  most beloved characters, the aging writer <>Kilgore Trout</>, finds to his horror that a Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously funny satire, as <>Vonnegut</> looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution in America and reminds us how to see the truth."
