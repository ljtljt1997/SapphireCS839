"<>E.E. Cummings</> is without question one of the major poets of this century, and this volume, first published in 1959, is indispensable for every lover of modern lyrical verse. It contains one hundred of <>Cummings</>'s wittiest and most profound poems, harvested from thirty-five of the most radically creative years in contemporary American poetry."
