"<>Henry David Thoreau</> (American, 1817 -- 1862) extracted himself from the routines of employment and civilized sociability to spend two years in the woods. Walden, <>Thoreau</>'s book about his experience published in 1854, has become one of the most highly respected works in American literature."
