"This Side of Paradise, <>F. Scott Fitzgerald</>'s romantic and witty first novel, was written when the author was only twenty-three years old. This semi-autobiographical story of the handsome, indulged, and idealistic Princeton student <>Amory Blaine</> received critical raves and catapulted <>Fitzgerald</> to instant fame."
