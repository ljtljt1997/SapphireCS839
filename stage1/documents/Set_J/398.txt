"A poignant coming-of-age novel set in a Welsh mining town, <>Richard Llewellyn</>'s How Green Was My Valley is a paean to a more innocent age, published in Penguin Modern Classics. Growing up in a mining community in rural South Wales, <>Huw Morgan</> is taught many harsh lessons - at the kitchen table, at Chapel and around the pit-head."
