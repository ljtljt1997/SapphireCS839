"This is a skeptic' s journey into the meaning of God and of human existence. At once an ironic rendering of the life of Christ and a beautiful novel, <>Saramago</>' s tale has sparked intense discussion about the meaning of Christianity and the Church as an institution. Translated by <>Giovanni Pontiero</>."
