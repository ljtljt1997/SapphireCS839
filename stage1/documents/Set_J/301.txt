"Just as <>Norman Maclean</> writes at the end of \"A River Runs through It\" that he is \"haunted by waters,\" so have readers been haunted by his novella. A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, <>Maclean</> produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the twentieth century."
