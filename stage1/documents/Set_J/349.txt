"Few works of political and cultural theory have been as enduringly provocative as <>Guy Debord</>'s The Society of the Spectacle. From its publication amid the social upheavals of the 1960s up to the present, the volatile theses of this book have decisively transformed debates on the shape of modernity, capitalism and everyday life in the late twentieth century."
