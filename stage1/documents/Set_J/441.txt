"New Yearâ€™s Eve, 1975: <>Arturo Belano</> and <>Ulises Lima</>, founders of the visceral realist movement in poetry, leave Mexico City in a borrowed white Impala. Their quest: to track down the obscure, vanished poet <>Cesarea Tinajero</>. A violent showdown in the Sonora desert turns search to flight; twenty years later <>Belano</> and <>Lima</> are still on the run."
