"A magnificent romantic/historical/adventure novel set in India at the time of mutiny. The Far Pavilions is a story of 19th Century India, when the thin patina of English rule held down dangerously turbulent undercurrents. It is a story about and English man - <>Ashton Pelham-Martyn</> - brought up as a Hindu and his passionate, but dangerous love for an Indian princess."
