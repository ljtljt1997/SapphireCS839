"Tom Wolfe's much-discussed kaleidoscopic non-fiction novel chronicles the tale of novelist <>Ken Kesey</> and his band of Merry Pranksters. In the 1960s, Kesey led a group of psychedelic sympathizers around the country in a painted bus, presiding over LSD-induced \"acid tests\" all along the way."
