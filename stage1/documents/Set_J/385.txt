"For this complete, authoritative English-language edition, <>D. J. Enright</> has revised the late <>Terence Kilmartin</>'s acclaimed reworking of <>C. K. Scott Moncrieff</>'s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of 'À la recherche du temps perdu' (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989)."
