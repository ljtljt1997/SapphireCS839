"The Threepenny Opera was <>Brecht</>'s first and greatest commercial success, and it remains one of his best-loved and most-performed plays. Based on <>John Gay</>'s eighteenth-century Beggar's Opera, the play is set in Victorian England's Soho but satirizes the bourgeois society of the Weimar Republic through its wry love story of Polly Peachum and Mack the Knife Macheath."
