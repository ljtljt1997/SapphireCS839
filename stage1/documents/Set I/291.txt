"That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of <>Ray Bradbury</>'s work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror."
