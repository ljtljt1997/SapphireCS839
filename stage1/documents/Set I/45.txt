"The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation, The Sun Also Rises is one of <>Ernest Hemingway</>'s masterpieces, and a classic example of his spare but powerful writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of <>Hemingway</>'s most unforgettable characters: <>Jake Barnes</> and Lady <>Brett Ashley</>."
