"This charming classic, first published in 1970, brings together twenty years of correspondence between <>Helene Hanff</>, a freelance writer living in New York City, and a used-book dealer in London. Through the years, though never meeting and separated both geographically and culturally, they share a winsome, sentimental friendship based on their common love for books."
