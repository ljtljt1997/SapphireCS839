"<>T.H White</>'s masterful retelling of the Arthurian legend is an abiding classic. Here all five volumes that make up the story are published in one volume, as <>White</> himself always wished. Exquisite comedy offsets the tragedy of <>Arthur</>'s personal doom as <>White</> brings to life the major British epic of all time with brilliance, grandeur, warmth and charm."
