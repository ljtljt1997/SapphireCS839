"Winner of the 1961 <>Hugo</> Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, <>Walter M. Miller</>, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz is a true landmark of twentieth-century literatureâ€”a chilling and still provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future."
