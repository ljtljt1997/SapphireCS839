"Psychiatrist <>Viktor Frankl</>'s memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, <>Frankl</> argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose."
