"Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evilâ€”what more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by <>Clive Staples Lewis</>. But <>Lewis </>did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia."
