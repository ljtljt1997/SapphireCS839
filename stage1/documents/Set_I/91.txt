"<>Matilda</> is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading <>Dickens</>. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in <>Matilda</>'s world."
