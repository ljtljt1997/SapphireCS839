"One night <>Max</> puts on his wolf suit and makes mischief of one kind and another, so his mother calls him 'Wild Thing' and sends him to bed without his supper. That night a forest begins to grow in <>Max</>'s room and an ocean rushes by with a boat to take <>Max<> to the place where the wild things are."
