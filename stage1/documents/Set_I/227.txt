"The book is structured as a series of loosely connected vignettes. <>Burroughs</> stated that the chapters are intended to be read in any order. The reader follows the narration of junkie <>William Lee</>, who takes on various aliases, from the U.S. to Mexico, eventually to Tangier and the dreamlike Interzone."
