"A loving threesome, they ranged the dark hills and river bottoms of Cherokee country. Old <>Dan</> had the brawn. Little <>Ann</> had the brains, and <>Billy</> had the will to make them into the finest hunting team in the valley. Glory and victory were coming to them, but sadness waited too. Where the Red Fern Grows is an exciting tale of love and adventure you'll never forget."
