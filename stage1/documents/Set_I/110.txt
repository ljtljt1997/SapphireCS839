"This novel of awesome beauty and power is a moving saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love. Through <>Jean M. Auel</>'s magnificent storytelling we are taken back to the dawn of modern humans, and with a girl named Ayla we are swept up in the harsh and beautiful Ice Age world they shared with the ones who called themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear."
