"<>Milkman Dead</> was born shortly after a neighborhood eccentric hurled himself off a rooftop in a vain attempt at flight. For the rest of his life he, too, will be trying to fly. With this brilliantly imagined novel, <>Toni Morrison</> transfigures the coming-of-age story as audaciously as <>Saul Bellow</> or Gabriel Garcia Marquez."
