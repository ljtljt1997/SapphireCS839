"The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of <>Nathan Price</>, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it -- from garden seeds to Scripture -- is calamitously transformed on African soil."
