"The year is 1945. <>Claire Randall</>, a former combat nurse, is just back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach-an outlander-in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of Our Lord...1743."
