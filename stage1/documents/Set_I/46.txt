"Loosely based on the Odyssey, this landmark of modern literature follows ordinary Dubliners in 1904. Capturing a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, his friends <>Buck Mulligan</> and <>Stephen Dedalus</>, his wife <>Molly</>, and a scintillating cast of supporting characters, <>Joyce</> pushes Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes."
