"<>Georg Trakl</>'s poems are considered some of the most difficult for any translator to tackle; his German is dense and sometimes almost impenetrable. <>Daniel Simko</>'s collection Autumn Sonata, has been lauded for the simplicity and directness of its translations, accomplished with out sacrificing the drama of <>Trakl</>'s rich imagery."
