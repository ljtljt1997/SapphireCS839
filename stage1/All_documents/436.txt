"The dazzling novel that established <>Walker Percy</> as one of the major voices in Southern literature is now available for the first time in Vintage paperback. The Moviegoer is <>Binx Bolling</>, a young New Orleans stockbroker who surveys the world with the detached gaze of a Bourbon Street dandy even as he yearns for a spiritual redemption he cannot bring himself to believe in."
