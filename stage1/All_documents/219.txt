"Set on the coast of England against the vivid background of the sea, The Waves introduces six characters-three men and three women-who are grappling with the death of a beloved friend, <>Percival</>. Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, <>Virgina Woolf</> draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies."
