"Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, <>Landon Carter</> remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was <>Jamie Sullivan</>, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister."
