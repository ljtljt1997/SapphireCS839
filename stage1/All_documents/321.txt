"Black Boy is a classic of American autobiography, a subtly crafted narrative of <>Richard Wright</>'s journey from innocence to experience in the Jim Crow South. An enduring story of one young man's coming of age during a particular time and place, Black Boy remains a seminal text in our history about what it means to be a man, black, and Southern in America."
