"<>Patrick Bateman</> is twenty-six and he works on Wall Street, he is handsome, sophisticated, charming and intelligent. He is also a psychopath. Taking us to head-on collision with America's greatest dream-and its worst nightmare-American Psycho is bleak, bitter, black comedy about a world we all recognise but do not wish to confront."
