"Meet <>Frank Cauldhame</>. Just sixteen, and unconventional to say the least:  Two years after I killed <>Blyth</> I murdered my young brother <>Paul</>, for quite different and more fundamental reasons than I'd disposed of <>Blyth</>, and then a year after that I did for my young cousin <>Esmerelda</>, more or less on a whim.  That's my score to date. Three."
