"A grand, sweeping saga of sacrifice and struggle, this epic tale recaptures the world of Norwegian homesteaders at the turn of the 20th century. It created an international sensation upon first publication and led to the author's 1920 <>Nobel</> Prize in Literature. Rich in symbolism, it continues to resonate with modern readers today."
