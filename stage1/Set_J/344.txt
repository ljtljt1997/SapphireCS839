"Winner of the 1933 Femina Vie <>Heureuse</> Prize, COLD COMFORT FARM is a wickedly funny portrait of British rural life in the 1930s. <>Flora Poste</>, a recently orphaned socialite, moves in with her country relatives, the gloomy Starkadders of Cold Comfort Farm, and becomes enmeshed in a web of violent emotions, despair, and scheming, until <>Flora</> manages to set things right."
